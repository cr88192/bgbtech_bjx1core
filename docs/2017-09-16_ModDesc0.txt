Module Descriptions:
	Framebuffer and audio will be driven off a 1kHz timer interrupt.
	
Audio:
*	Will submit 2 blocks, encoding 32 samples, each clock tick.
*	These will be a special type of pipeline register.
**		Tick will be 1ms, but the size and format of blocks may vary.

Video:
*	Will provide a 4kB buffer for submitting part of the image frame.
**		This will need to be roughly synchronized with the raster scan.
**		240 or 480 vertical resolution will depend on block transmission.
***		For 240, the same blocks will be sent for both even and odd fields.
***		For 480, different blocks will be sent for even and odd fields.
